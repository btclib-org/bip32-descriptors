"""Which of `parse`'s refusals a descriptor built by hand meets too.

A field of the wrong type, in every `Descriptor` fragment and in a
`MultiA`, leaves as a `BTClibTypeError`, and so does a `Miniscript`
node's fragment, threshold or digest of the wrong type, its keys given
as no tuple, or a key that is no `KeyExpression`. `TrDescriptor`,
`MiniscriptDescriptor`, `UnusedDescriptor`, `ShDescriptor`,
`WshDescriptor` and `MultiA` also refuse a value `parse` refuses, as a
`BTClibValueError`, and every fragment holding a key that `parse` reads
outside ``tr()`` and ``rawtr()``, and a P2WSH `Miniscript` node, refuses
a ``musig()`` one and an x-only one. Issues
btclib-org/bip32-descriptors#46, btclib-org/bip32-descriptors#85,
btclib-org/bip32-descriptors#103, btclib-org/bip32-descriptors#119,
btclib-org/bip32-descriptors#134, btclib-org/bip32-descriptors#141,
btclib-org/bip32-descriptors#150, btclib-org/bip32-descriptors#158,
btclib-org/bip32-descriptors#159, btclib-org/bip32-descriptors#161 and
btclib-org/bip32-descriptors#170.

`KeyExpression` refuses a `pub_key` that `parse` refuses, an x-only key
with no `pub_key`, a `pub_key` beside another key or a derivation, and a
hardening symbol BIP380 does not allow. Issues
btclib-org/bip32-descriptors#171 and btclib-org/bip32-descriptors#178.

It also refuses a ``musig()`` with an `xkey`, an `origin`, or a
participant that is a ``musig()``, x-only, uncompressed or no
`KeyExpression`. A path or a wildcard on a ``musig()`` is refused where
it hardens, or where a participant is not extended or is ranged. A
wildcard is refused unless it is None, 0 or 2**31. Issue
btclib-org/bip32-descriptors#179.

A ``musig()`` whose `hardening` is not h is refused too. Issue
btclib-org/bip32-descriptors#181.

`WshDescriptor` refuses an argument holding an uncompressed key, and
`ShDescriptor` a ``wsh()`` one. Both refuse an argument holding a
``musig()`` or an x-only key, and one whose script size or number of
``multi()`` keys `parse` refuses there. Issues
btclib-org/bip32-descriptors#175 and btclib-org/bip32-descriptors#233.

`ShDescriptor` refuses the argument of a ``wsh()`` argument as
`WshDescriptor` refuses it, a value of the wrong type included, and by
its function before its keys, as `parse` does. Issue
btclib-org/bip32-descriptors#242.

`WpkhDescriptor` and a P2WSH `Miniscript` node refuse an uncompressed
key, `MultiDescriptor` no keys, more than 20 keys and a k outside 1 to
n, and `RawPkhDescriptor` an empty hash and one of other than 20 bytes,
each with `parse`'s message. Issue btclib-org/bip32-descriptors#200.

`TrDescriptor` and `RawTrDescriptor` refuse an uncompressed key with
`parse`'s message. A `MultiA` and a tapscript `Miniscript` node refuse
one too, without the key's position in the ``tr()`` that `parse`
names. Issue btclib-org/bip32-descriptors#221.

`TrDescriptor` and `MiniscriptDescriptor` refuse a node holding a number
of keys its fragment does not take, with the node's own message, before
its text is written. Where the descriptor also holds an uncompressed key
and the node's text can be written, the node is left to the descriptor's
text and sanity checks; where it passes them, ``tr()`` and ``wsh()``
refuse that key by its position, and a bare `MiniscriptDescriptor`
builds it. Issue btclib-org/bip32-descriptors#235.

A `MultiDescriptor` of more than three keys that ``sh()`` or ``wsh()``
takes builds, and as a top-level descriptor writes a text `parse`
refuses: its docstring says why. Issue btclib-org/bip32-descriptors#226.

A `MultiDescriptor` that no position takes is refused when built, with
the message `parse` gives inside ``sh()``: more than three keys, one of
them uncompressed, whose redeem script is over the push limit of
``sh()``. Issue btclib-org/bip32-descriptors#251.

`TrDescriptor`, `MiniscriptDescriptor`, `WshDescriptor`, and
`ShDescriptor` for a ``wsh()`` argument, refuse an unpickled node holding
a number of subexpressions its fragment does not take, with the node's
own message, before its text is written: after its context and its
fragment, before its keys. Issue btclib-org/bip32-descriptors#275.

`TrDescriptor` refuses an unpickled ``multi()`` in a tapscript leaf, and
`MiniscriptDescriptor`, `WshDescriptor` and `ShDescriptor` for a
``wsh()`` argument an unpickled ``multi_a()``, as the node's own build
refuses it: whatever its number of keys, after the type of its keys, and
with its message. Issue btclib-org/bip32-descriptors#243.

`TrDescriptor` and `MiniscriptDescriptor` refuse an unpickled node
holding a key that is no `KeyExpression`, before they count its keys.
Issue btclib-org/bip32-descriptors#246. `TrDescriptor` refuses an
unpickled `MultiA` leaf whose keys are not a tuple of `KeyExpression`,
before it reads a key. Issue btclib-org/bip32-descriptors#249.

`TrDescriptor` and `MiniscriptDescriptor` refuse an unpickled node whose
fragment is no `str`, after its context and before its keys. Issue
btclib-org/bip32-descriptors#250.

`Miniscript`, `TrDescriptor` and `MiniscriptDescriptor` refuse a
fragment that is a `str` subclass as they refuse one that is no `str`,
whether it hashes or not. Issue btclib-org/bip32-descriptors#260.

A `MiniscriptDescriptor` builds, and as a top-level descriptor writes a
text `parse` refuses: its docstring says why. Issue
btclib-org/bip32-descriptors#253.

`ShDescriptor` and `WshDescriptor` refuse an unpickled argument holding
a key that is no `KeyExpression` before its other keys, their number and
its script size, and after its function unless it is a ``multi()``.
Issue btclib-org/bip32-descriptors#257.

`WshDescriptor`, and `ShDescriptor` for a ``wsh()`` argument, refuse an
unpickled `MiniscriptDescriptor` before writing its text: for its nodes
and for a node holding a number of keys its fragment does not take, as
its own build refuses them, and for its keys between the two, as
`parse` refuses them. Issues btclib-org/bip32-descriptors#259 and
btclib-org/bip32-descriptors#261.

`WshDescriptor`, and `ShDescriptor` for a ``multi()`` argument and for
one inside a ``wsh()`` argument, refuse an unpickled ``multi()`` holding
a field of the wrong type, as `MultiDescriptor` refuses it and before
its function, and one whose threshold is out of range, where its text
can be written, in `parse`'s order and with its message. Issues
btclib-org/bip32-descriptors#248, btclib-org/bip32-descriptors#264 and
btclib-org/bip32-descriptors#272.

`WshDescriptor`, and `ShDescriptor` for a ``wsh()`` argument, refuse an
unpickled `MiniscriptDescriptor` whose text `parse` reads as a
descriptor function, or that is not sane, with `MiniscriptDescriptor`'s
message, once its nodes and keys pass. They do not ask again the sanity
of one `parse` or `infer_descriptor` has read. Issue
btclib-org/bip32-descriptors#267.

`WshDescriptor` and `ShDescriptor` refuse an unpickled ``sh()`` or
``wsh()`` argument in a position `parse` refuses it without writing the
text of what it holds, as their docstrings say. Issue
btclib-org/bip32-descriptors#269.

`WshDescriptor`, and `ShDescriptor` for its argument and for one inside
a ``wsh()`` argument, refuse an unpickled ``raw()`` whose script, or
``rawpkh()`` whose key hash, is no bytes, as its own build refuses it.
Issue btclib-org/bip32-descriptors#271.

`WshDescriptor`, and `ShDescriptor` for its argument and for the argument
of a ``wsh()`` argument, refuse an unpickled argument whose network is no
`str` as `Descriptor` refuses it, before anything else about the
argument: its position, and the fields of the wrong type of the
paragraphs above, are refused after it. Issue
btclib-org/bip32-descriptors#276.

`WshDescriptor`, and `ShDescriptor` for its argument and for one inside
a ``wsh()`` argument, refuse an unpickled ``rawpkh()`` whose hash is
empty or of other than 20 bytes, as its own build refuses it, in the
order `_assert_inner` gives. Issue btclib-org/bip32-descriptors#281.

A descriptor, a `MultiA` and a ``musig()`` refuse a key that is no
point, which `miniscript.from_script` reads, with `parse`'s message, the
last two lacking the key's position. Issue
btclib-org/bip32-descriptors#292.

`TrDescriptor` and `MiniscriptDescriptor` refuse an unpickled node whose
fragment is a `str` the library does not define, as `Miniscript` refuses
it, before its keys, echoing no value it holds. So do `WshDescriptor`,
and `ShDescriptor` for a ``wsh()`` argument, where the node is in an
unpickled `MiniscriptDescriptor`. Issue btclib-org/bip32-descriptors#285.

`TrDescriptor`, `MiniscriptDescriptor`, `WshDescriptor`, and
`ShDescriptor` for a ``wsh()`` argument, refuse an unpickled node whose
subexpressions are no tuple, naming the type alone, after its context
and fragment and before its keys, as its build refuses it. Issue
btclib-org/bip32-descriptors#287.

`TrDescriptor`, `MiniscriptDescriptor`, `WshDescriptor` and
`ShDescriptor` refuse an unpickled node whose type and bounds are not
those its build computes from its subexpressions, before its sanity is
asked. A node left to those checks for its number of keys, as above, is
asked, and so are the nodes above it, unless it is a multisig. Issue
btclib-org/bip32-descriptors#286.

Before its type and bounds, a node is refused for a threshold or a lock
time out of range or of another type, with the message of its own
build. Issue btclib-org/bip32-descriptors#284.

`TrDescriptor` refuses an unpickled `MultiA` leaf whose k is no integer,
as its build refuses it, then one of more keys than BIP387 allows, then
one of a k outside 1 to n, with `parse`'s message. Issue
btclib-org/bip32-descriptors#313.

`TrDescriptor` and `RawTrDescriptor` refuse an unpickled ``musig()``
key holding a participant `KeyExpression` refuses, with `parse`'s
message where it has one, naming the participant by the position
`parse` names. Issue btclib-org/bip32-descriptors#300.
